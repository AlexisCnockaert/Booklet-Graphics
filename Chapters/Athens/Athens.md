# Vector graphics in Athens

There are two different computer graphics: vector and raster graphics.
Raster graphics represents images as a collection of pixels. Vector graphics
is the use of geometric primitives such as points, lines, curves, or polygons
to represent images. These primitives are created using mathematical equations.

Both types of computer graphics have advantages and disadvantages.
The advantages of vector graphics over raster are:

- smaller size,
- ability to zoom indefinitely,
- moving, scaling, filling, and rotating do not degrade the quality of an image.

Ultimately, picture on a computer are displayed on a screen with a specific
display dimension. However, while raster graphic doesn't scale very well when
the resolution differ too much from the picture resolution, vector graphics
are rasterized to fit the display they will appear on. Rasterization is the
technique of taking an image described in a vector graphics format and
transform it into a set of pixels for output on a screen.

Morphic is the way to do graphics with Pharo.
However, most existing canvas are pixel based, and not vector based.
This can be an issue with current IT ecosystems, where the resolution can differ from machine to machine (desktop, tablet, phones, etc...)

Enter Athens, a vector based graphic API. Under the scene, it can either use
balloon Canvas, or the cairo graphic library for the rasterization phase.

## Example

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to understand the example below:

```smalltalk
|surface|
surface := AthensCairoSurface   extent: 400@400.

surface drawDuring: [ :canvas | |paint font|

paint := (PolymorphSystemSettings pharoLogoForm) asAthensPaintOn: canvas.
 
canvas setPaint: (
 (LinearGradientPaint from: 0@0  to: 400@400) 
 colorRamp: {  
  0 -> (Color red alpha: 0.8).
  0.166 -> (Color orange alpha: 0.8).
  0.332 -> (Color yellow alpha: 0.8).
  0.5 -> (Color green alpha: 0.8).
  0.664 -> (Color blue alpha: 0.8).
  0.83 -> (Color magenta alpha: 0.8).
  1 -> (Color purple alpha: 0.8). 
 }).

canvas drawShape: (0@0 extent: 400@400). 
paint maskOn: canvas.
 
font := LogicalFont familyName: 'Source Sans Pro' pointSize: 30.
canvas setFont: font.
canvas setPaint:(  (LinearGradientPaint from: 0@0  to: 100@150)
 colorRamp: {  
  0 -> (Color white alpha: 0.9).
  1 -> (Color black alpha: 0.9).}).
canvas pathTransform translateX: 20 Y: 180 + (font getPreciseAscent); scaleBy: 1.1; rotateByDegrees: 25.

canvas drawString: 'Hello Athens in Pharo'

"canvas draw."

].

surface asForm
```

## Athens details

`AthensSurface` and its subclass `AthensCairoSurface` will initialize a new surface.
The surface represent the area in pixel where your drawing will be rendered. You
never draw directly on the surface. Instead, you specify what you want to display
on the canvas, and Athens will render your it on the area specified by the surface.

The class `AthensCanvas` is the central object used to perform drawing on an `AthensSurface`
A canvas is not directly instanciated but used through a call like
`surface drawDuring: [:canvas | .... ]`

The Athens drawing model relies on a three layer model. Any drawing process
takes place in three steps:

- First, a painting must be defined, which may be a color, a color gradient, or a bitmap.
- Then a `path` is created, which includes one or more vector primitives , i.e., lines, TrueType fonts, BÃ©zier curves, etc... This path will define the shape that is then rendered.
- Finally the result is drawn to the Athens surface, which is provided by the back-end for the output.

### Paint

Paint can be:

- a single color, defined with the message *color:*
- A radial gradient paint, defined through object *RadialGradientPaint*
- a linear gradient paint, defined through object *LinearGradientPaint*
- a bitmap you can get by sending *asAthensPaintOn:* to a *Form*.

The way the paint is applied in the canvas is specified as *Fill* or *Stroke* that we will see in detail:

- *setPaint:* message will fill the Paint in the area defined by the path.
- *setStrokePaint:* message will set the paint as a virtual pen along the path.

Let see some example to better understand how it works.

#### Stroke paint (a pen that goes around the path)

The **stroke** operation takes a virtual pen along the path. It allows the source to transfer through the mask in a thin \(or thick\) line around the path

```smalltalk
|surface|
surface := AthensCairoSurface extent: 200@200.

surface drawDuring: [ :canvas | 
        surface clear: Color white.
        canvas setStrokePaint:  Color red.
        canvas drawShape: (20@20 extent: 160@160). 
].

surface asForm
```

The paint can be customized like

```smalltalk
|surface|
surface := AthensCairoSurface extent: 200@200.

surface drawDuring: [ :canvas | 
        surface clear: Color white.
        canvas setStrokePaint:  Color red.
        canvas paint dashes: #( "fill"5   "gap" 15) offset: 5.
        canvas paint capSquare.
        canvas paint width: 10.
        canvas drawShape: (20@20 extent: 160@160). 
].

surface asForm
```

#### Fill paint (a paint that fill the area defined by the path)

!!! Gradient
Gradient will let you create gradient of color, either linear, or radial.

The color ramp is a collection of associations with keys - floating point values
between 0 and 1 and values with Colors, for example:
{0 -> Color blue . 0.5 -> Color white. 1 -> Color red}.

full example with all paints:

```language=smalltalk
|surface|
surface := AthensCairoSurface extent: 200@200.

surface drawDuring: [ :canvas |
"Bitmap fill"
    canvas setPaint: (PolymorphSystemSettings pharoLogoForm asAthensPaintOn: canvas ).
    canvas drawShape: (0@0 extent: 100@100).

"plain color fill"
    canvas setPaint:  (Color yellow alpha: 0.9).
    canvas drawShape: (100@0 extent: 200@100).

"linear gradient fill"
    canvas setPaint:  ((LinearGradientPaint from: 0@100  to: 100@200) colorRamp: {  0 -> Color white. 1 -> Color black }).
    canvas drawShape: (0@100 extent: 100@200).

"Radial gradient fill"
    canvas setPaint: ((RadialGradientPaint new) colorRamp: { 0 -> Color white. 1 -> Color black }; center: 150@150; radius: 50; focalPoint: 180@180).
    canvas drawShape: (100@100 extent: 200@200).
 ].
surface asForm 
```

Start and stop point are reference to the current shape being drawn.
Exemple:
Create a vertical gradient

```language=smalltalk
canvas
    setPaint:
        \(canvas surface
            createLinearGradient:
                {\(0 -> Color blue\).
                \(0.5 -> Color white\).
                \(1 -> Color red\)}
            start: 0@200
            stop: 0@400\). 
    canvas drawShape: \(0@200 extent: 300@400\).
```

create a horizontal gradient:

```language=smalltalk
canvas
    setPaint:
        \(canvas surface
            createLinearGradient:
                {\(0 -> Color blue\).
                \(0.5 -> Color white\).
                \(1 -> Color red\)}
            start: 0@200
            stop: 300@200\). 
    canvas drawShape: \(0@200 extent: 300@400\).
```

create a diagonal gradient:

```language=smalltalk
canvas
    setPaint:
        \(canvas surface
            createLinearGradient:
                {\(0 -> Color blue\).
                \(0.5 -> Color white\).
                \(1 -> Color red\)}
            start: 0@200
            stop: 300@400\). 
    canvas drawShape: \(0@200 extent: 300@400\).
```

### Path

Athens always has an active path.

Use `AthensPathBuilder` or `AthensSimplePathBuilder` to build a path
They will assemble segment for you

The method `createPath:` exists in all important Athens class: `AthensCanvas`,
`AthensSurface`, and  `AthensPathBuilder`.
The message `createPath: aPath`

Using it returns a new path:

```language=smalltalk
surface createPath: [:builder |
  builder
   absolute;
   moveTo: 100@100;
   lineTo: 100@300;
   lineTo: 300@300;
   lineTo: 300@100;
   close ].
```

Here are some helper messages in `AthensSimplePathBuilder`:

- `pathStart`
- `pathBounds` gives the limit of the bounds associated to the path

If you want to build path using only straight line, you can use the class `AthensPolygon`.

|path builder Messages  |Object Segment     |comment                     |
|~~~~~~~~~~~-|~~~~~~~~~-|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
|ccwArcTo: angle:       |AthensCCWArcSegment|counter clock wise segment  |
|cwArcTo:angle:         |AthensCWArcSegment |clock wise segment          |
|lineTo:                |AthensLineSegment  |straight line               |
|moveTo:                |AthensMoveSegment  |start a new contour         |
|curveVia: to:          |AthensQuadSegment  |quadric bezier curve        |
|curveVia: and: to:     |AthensCubicSegment |Cubic bezier curve          |
|reflectedCurveVia: to: |AthensCubicSegment |Reflected cubic bezier curve|
|string: font:          |                   |specific to cairo           |
|close                  |AthensCloseSegment |close the current contour   |

### Coordinate class: **Absolute** or **Relative**

#### Absolute: absolute coordinate from surface coordinate

This will draw a square in a surface which extent is 400@400 using absolute move.

```language=smalltalk
builder absolute;
   moveTo: 100@100;
   lineTo: 100@300;
   lineTo: 300@300;
   lineTo: 300@100;
   close
]]]

relative: each new move is relative to the previous one.
This will draw a square in a surface which extent is 400@400 using relative move.
[[[language=smalltalk
 builder relative ;
  moveTo: 100@100;
  lineTo: 200@0;
  lineTo: 0@200;
  lineTo: -200@0;
  close
]]]

cwArcTo:angle: and ccwArcTo: angle: will draw circular arc, connecting  
previous segment endpoint and current endpoint of given angle, passing in
clockwise or counter clockwise direction. The angle must be specified in Radian.

Please remember that the circumference of a circle is equal to 2 Pi  R.
If R = 1, half of the circumference is equal to PI, which is the value of half a circle.

#### curveVia: to: and |curveVia: and: to

This call is related to bezier curve. A BÃ©zier curve consists of two or more
 control points, which define the size and shape of the line. The first and
 last points mark the beginning and end of the path, while the intermediate
 points define the path's curvature.

 More detail on Bezier curve on available at: <https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/>

#### path transformation

A path can be rotated, translated and scaled so you can adapt it to your need.
For example, you can define a path in your own coordinate system, and then
scale it to match the size of your surface extent.



## drawing

Either you set the shape first and then you call **draw**, or you call the
convenient method **drawShape:** directly with the path to draw as argument

### Some example

```language=smalltalk
"canvas pathTransform loadIdentity.  font1 getPreciseAscent. font getPreciseHeight"
   surface clear.
   canvas
    setPaint:
     ((LinearGradientPaint from: 0 @ 0 to: self extent)
      colorRamp:
       {(0 -> Color white).
       (1 -> Color black)}).
   canvas drawShape: (0 @ 0 extent: self extent).
   canvas
    setPaint:
     (canvas surface
      createLinearGradient:
       {(0 -> Color blue).
       (0.5 -> Color white).
       (1 -> Color red)}
      start: 0@200
      stop: 0@400). "change to 200 to get an horizontal gradient"
   canvas drawShape: (0@200 extent: 300@400).
   canvas setFont: font.
   canvas
    setPaint:
     (canvas surface

### practicing Athens drawing

To help you practice your Athens drawing, you can use Athens sketch, migrated from SmalltalkHub that is available at
[Athens Sketch: https://github.com/rvillemeur/AthensSketch](https://github.com/rvillemeur/AthensSketch)
